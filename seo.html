                SEO is a complex and almost controversial subject now days. SEO stands for search engine optimization and each search 
                engine has it's own complex algorithm it uses to filter relevant data to different searchers depending on their query.
                Each SEO algorithm is different from the other, but they all share some common grounds in terms of general principle.
                Some general things an algorithm will look for include matches to keywords, backlinks to your website, proper HTML meta
                formatting, proper sized headers and content tags and much more. These basic things are well known in the development 
                community and advised by many templates.

                Good SEO will generally place your website in front of more relevant customers for free. This is a long term growth 
                strategy that helps established and trusted businesses stay at the front lines of the otherwise wild world of the web.
                Good SEO helps promote accountability and quality. Some debates exist on how well the current algorithms are doing at
                this and what the future will look like. It might not be far from now where regulations are placed on SEO algorithms.
                That, however, is a subject for another post.
