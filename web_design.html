                I felt more in my element this week. It's nice to look at surface level web technology and know what's happening behind
                the scenes. At least, the week wasn't about web technology as much as web design. I'm more of a backend developer, 
                but I have a basic idea of web design. It's not just about making a website look good, it's about making it feel good 
                and act inutility in the hands of a user. I felt that the basic rundown this class offers is sufficient for those who
                aren't building from scratch. A lot of the site builders have pre-made grids that they constrain you in and this can 
                take away a lot of the stress for newbies building a website for the first time.

                I felt this week went fairly quickly for me. I've spent a bit of time studying these subjects outside of this class.
                I don't think I'll be able to make something as nice as a site builder would on the front end, but I can defiantly 
                make something that will load faster and that I'll have full customization of. That's worth something in and of itself.
                My next steps will be building the website and getting content put on it, then applying for affiliate links and making 
                videos to pair with it all. We'll see how it goes. I'll admit a lot of this is just to meet the requirements of the class.
                If I were going to invest again, I would probably do a manufacturing model and sell using PayPal as my data-end. I can't
                exactly afford my own server board to run a website off of.
