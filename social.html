                Knowing how to use social media is what separates powerful and dynamic businesses from legacy businesses who pay
                too much for consumer data. One of the biggest changes in the modern market was the advent of social media. People,
                or customers in the eyes of businesses, were giving away information about themselves in mass. What used to take 
                years of market research to figure out could now be found with the quick sweep of an algorithm. In this was, the users
                of social media websites have made themselves the product being sold. This is very useful information for businesses.

                On that slightly creepy note, I'll lightly talk about some of the advantages of using social media for small businesses.
                I prefer YouTube myself, staying away from services, if they can be called that, like Facebook and Twitter. YouTube is
                awesome for affiliates in particular. It hosts the ability to deliver high engagement content to your audience directly.
                Feedback from the audience is immediate as well and in multiple ways. Community is also built up on this particular platform,
                which tends to lead to longer lasting followings. In these ways, social media can benefit companies without invasive programs
                on customers. Regardless, social media is also a great way to boost generic SEO by building relevance in a community and 
                backlinks to your website.
