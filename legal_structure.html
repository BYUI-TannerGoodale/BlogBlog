            <p class="p">
                This week I got to choose the legal structure I wanted to build my business on and what the taxes would look like for
                that chosen structure. There are a number of different legal structures, all offering their own advantages and
                disadvantages alike. I won't go into great detail on the many different types, but I will talk a bit about the sole 
                proprietor structure and how it makes sense with a small affiliate blog.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                So, the first thing to address here, what is a sole proprietor? Put simply, a sole proprietor is a single owner of a 
                business who takes upon themselves all legal risks and obligations relate to business operations. A sole proprietor has
                the sole responsibility for the business and can dictate operations without need for approval for a board. This means
                that as a sole proprietor, you can make any decisions you want and reap the rewards in full. Money earned from the 
                business is counted as income into your pocket. However, you also carry all legal risk on your shoulders. Should your
                company be sued, it would be you paying out of pocket on all legal fees. This can break a business and a home overnight.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Now, let's talk about how this legal structure makes sense in the context of an affiliate marketer. As an affiliate, you
                don't have many inherent risks. You quite literally market an item and offer a link to sell it. Once a customer buys
                from you, your part in the transaction is over. The market you lead a buyer to has to take full legal burden at that point.
                Where the crazy comes in is your taxes. As a sole proprietor, your taxes from affiliate marketing will be mingled with
                your taxes from other income sources. Not to mention that the company paying you treats you as a contractor. Meaning that
                they withhold no earnings. This means you have to pay self-employment taxes on all of your affiliate earnings.
            </p>
            <p class="p pb2">
                At the end of the day, even though it's expensive tax wise, it still makes sense to be a sole proprietor as an affiliate
                marketer. You can set up a business overnight, usually don't need any special permits or licenses and you carry very 
                little risk. This makes sole proprietorship an ideal starting point for an affiliate marketer.
