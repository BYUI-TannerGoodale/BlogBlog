                The funny thing about optimization is that you can only optimize after your product has been in the wild and tested.
                In terms of ads, it's a relatively easy thing to optimize given the raw numeric data that can be gathered and measured
                against. This tends to make things much easier then working with abstract variables. With that being said, this week
                I was able to take a look and pre-cautiously optimize my ads off of common trends. I haven't run them too long, but I 
                have found that much of my initial quick assumptions were in need of refinement. Next week I'll really have the change
                to measure the success rate of my ads and keywords and work accordingly.

                We also looked into ROI or return on investment this week. The simple principle is this, your ROI is key in defining 
                a successful ad. If your cost for the add is less then the profit gathered from a conversion, then you have a good ROI.
                If, however, your ad costs more to run per conversion then your conversion is worth, you have a bad ROI and should adjust
                immediately. In some cases, the best thing might be to pause or even delete the ad all together.
