                This week I was able to learn about link building. Link building is a crucial part of SEO and the practice has changed
                a lot of over the past few years. Dirty SEO used to involve getting links out to your website no matter the quality
                of said links. This lead to spamming issues and low quality linking, forcing search engines to lower the effect of link
                building and modify the way it's calculated entirely. Modern link building should not be spammy or forced at all, but 
                focus more on developing natural connections with the industry of choice.

                Natural link building as it is had more so now is closer in line with the original intent. That is, as you develop a 
                following and people reference your website through links, you get high quality back links which will boost SEO by a
                significant margin. The focus should mainly be on developing high quality content that is worthy of being linked to 
                and building a name and reputation as an authority in your chosen community. This will naturally develop backlinks and
                help your SEO ranking.
