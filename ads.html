                I ended up doing something entirely different then I initially set out to do. I was going to do a BBQ blog to coincide
                with summer. I had the gear set up, the plan was set up, the web template was built, and then I remembered that I'm
                not a professional pit master and barely know what I'm doing half the time. So I went back to square one and though, "what
                am I actually good at/knowledgeable in?" and I landed on fishing. Now, most people know how to fish in general, and there 
                are many different forms of fishing, but I have had the privilege in my life to fish a big river and have some success doing
                so. It was at the moment I decided to change things up.

                Now that that's explained, lets talk about ads. I made an ad for the website last week and refine it this week. I find that 
                simple, to the point and direct ads seem to be the most effective at capturing my attention, so I mimicked that behavior in 
                my ad. Google's ad creation process is a bit awkward in my opinion. Outside of that, I definitely see the shortcomings of my ads,
                but I'm having fun making the content and at the end of the day, especially with the way the world is looking, that's 
                good enough right now.
