            <p class="p">
                I've never considered myself much of a business man. The whole idea of business seemed too competitive and corporate in
                my mind. Though many of us daydream of being "the boss" as kids, I think many more of us outgrow that later in life. I don't
                much care for the nature of business, I just want to be able to provide for my family and live a peaceful life out in 
                the country side. Alas, I worry that this too is but a daydream of my youth. Nevertheless, I'm here now; starting a 
                "business" in order to fulfill the requirements to get my degree in web development.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                I had the opportunity to research different web business models this week. The standard play of mercantile models crossed
                my screen. Drop shipping, manufacturing, the actual merchant model itself and so many more were covered. I think it a 
                funny that people use the web for traditional models, but the fact is, they still work. I don't have much an interest in
                any of these models though. I attempted before and found little success, no success to be honest. This can probably be
                marked up to me simply being bad at traditional business models.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                In spite of my feelings on the subject, I have to simply grin and bear the idea of running a business. I might not be 
                running one personally in the future, but I will be working with one regardless. If I really want to be able to provide
                for my family and get that plot of country land before it's gone, I'm going to have to get an idea of how to work in the
                world of business.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Naturally, putting so many years of my life into learning web development, I took more of an interest in the virtual models.
                One such that stuck out to me was the affiliate model. I don't anticipate making money off of the idea, but I do think I can
                loose less money then if I attempted a traditional business model. One thing I learned about business, sometimes it's 
                a matter of loosing less then gaining more. I can build my website with relative ease, I can host it on a free CDN,
                I can get approved as an affiliate and make engaging content. Honestly, it might even be a little fun. So, I chose the 
                affiliate model.

                A classic blog and YouTube channel will probably be my game plan for it. I don't plan on going over the top or buying 
                recording equipment either, I got a buddy who already did, so I can use his gear. I figure that putting myself on two
                different platforms will be the easiest way to get an audience. Anyway, I got a family to feed so wish me luck.
                Hopefully I won't loose too much of my wife's money.
