                Google Analytics is a powerful tool for any web developer. It allows you to be able to see who is visiting the website,
                where they are from, what device they are using, how they navigate the website and much more. Small things can make or 
                break an interaction on a website, including navigation difficulties that may be unforeseen by a development team.

                One of the especially powerful aspects of Google analytics is being able to use it to track AdWords goals. By linking
                a AdWords account, you can manage interactions and see how different ads preform once a user is directed to your website.
                The ability to tweak a website to meet these goals is great, but the knowledge on what to tweak is vital and Analytics
                provides this otherwise priceless and difficult to obtain information in an automated way. It's because of this data 
                offered that Google Analytics has become a mainstay in front end development projects.
