            <p class="p">
                What do you have to offer and how can you monetize it? I suppose this is the key question to ask when your looking to
                open a business. This week I had a chance to study up on different business models and source product ideas. My class
                was introduced to Google Trends this week and we were encouraged to look for products to focus on as well as a business
                model to build on. We covered the classic merchant model, manufacturer model, drop shipping model and the affiliate
                model. I'll attempt to give a brief summery of those four.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt2 bh3">Merchant Model</h3>
            <p class="p">
                The merchant model is the classic ideal of a business. You purchase product at wholesale prices and resell them at a
                markup to turn a profit. There isn't much more to it. In order to fulfill this model, a potential merchant will have 
                to find a supplier, purchase inventory and then store and ship product as orders come in. Because of this, you will
                have a fairly high startup cost and risk. On the other hand, This model gives you control over your product and 
                fulfillment pipeline.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt2 bh3">Manufacturer Model</h3>
            <p class="p">
                The manufacturer model is similar to the merchant model, but involves you creating a product and either selling direct
                to the public or selling it to a retailer. volume and resources are primary restrictions to consider with this model.
                One of the big advantages of this model is that you essentially get to set your own price, so long as you cover cost
                of production. This can be either a large scale operation or a small scale one, and thus eatery cost differs. Fulfillment
                is handled much the same way as a merchant model or by a merchant you sell to.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="mt2 bh3">Drop Shipping Model</h3>
            <p class="p">
                The drop shipping model is closer to a classic web monetization focus while also maintaining elements of the traditional
                retail models. Drop shipping essentially means you take orders from customers and then contact your supplier who in turn
                fulfills the order for you. Drop shipping has a very low entry point, so a lot of people are crowding the market. One of 
                the disadvantages of drop shipping is that you don't have control of your fulfillment process. It offers a bit more risk
                because of that but can have high returns on profit.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="mt2 bh3">Affiliate Model</h3>
            <p class="p">
                The affiliate model is a true blue web based model with no physical product and no fulfillment pipeline that you have to
                worry about. The affiliate model involves advertising for a company on your website and offering links to their products.
                When a customer buys one of their products through your link, you make a small commission. This isn't exactly a get rich
                quick model, it's a long game model if you want it to be profitable. I can see the affiliate model paring well with a 
                following or a good content creator with a decent sum of fans.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="mt2 bh3">My Choice</h3>
            <p class="p">
                With all these models to choose from, I had to consider what my strengths were and what I was able to bring to the table.
                I don't have any money to seriously invest so merchant was out the door. I attempted drop shipping in the past but found
                that getting reliable suppliers is a very difficult task. I don't have the time to manufacture orders and don't want to
                spend money on maintaining a large website with a secure database, so manufacturing and eCommerce websites are out.
                This leaves me the affiliate model. I can build a simple front end website with links and host it on a CDN, this blog is
                proof of that. I figure that I could make a YouTube channel and hook my website up to it, start building an audience, 
                and then apply for affiliate links.
            </p>
            <p class="p pb2">
                So, in the end, because of the low eatery point, I've decided to build an affiliate website. Summer is right around the
                corner and people across the US are starting to fire up their grills, so maybe I can use my talent for BBQ and build a 
                silly little blog/channel out of it to fulfill the requirements for the class. If I build a small audience along the way
                and make a penny or two after spending ten, I'd be ok with that.
