                I wouldn't call myself a seasoned web developer, but I've been doing it long enough to have an idea on how to handle 
                building a website and getting free hosting. For this semester, I intend on doing just that to fulfill the requirements
                of this course. I'll be honest, my approach is almost entirely academic in nature and doesn't reflect my actual business
                intentions. I chose affiliate marketing because I could do it for virtually free. The price of a domain is negligible.
                I'll be hard coding my website this semester and hosting it on this platform with a custom URL or domain name.

                The class reviewed website building and hosting options this week. I'm glad that a lot of the business students don't 
                have to learn HTML and build from the ground up, it can be very overwhelming at first. They were shown site builders like
                Wix and Weebly, perfectly suitable for the needs of this course, not so much for a full scale business model though. 
                Still, it'll provide the experience they need in web building and hosting. As for me, given the knowledge, I'm going to 
                hard code and use a free CDN, the exact same way this website is built and hosted. I'll just get a custom domain and 
                make the affiliate site more styled and interactive, probably have a good portion of JavaScript added as well. As for 
                a template, I think this website will do. I'll rip the code from this build (my own work) and rewrite sections to make
                the other website. Should be a fairly simple process. I'll just need images and content before I can apply for an affiliate
                partnership at Amazon.
