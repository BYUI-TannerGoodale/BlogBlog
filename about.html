                This is Blog Blog. It's a silly, almost satire, blog site that has an awful url so it generates almost no natural SEO.
                My name is Tanner Goodale, I'm the guy who codes and maintains this silly little thing. In the spirit of transparency,
                I'll explain what this is about. Many of my classes (yes I'm a student) involve writing blog posts for some reason or
                another. Rather then putting myself on an actual blog site, I decided I would build my own that would be seen by almost
                nobody. If you find yourself here, then you either were sent a link or you got very very lost while surfing the web.
                Either way, I welcome you.
